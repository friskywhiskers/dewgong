# dewgong
[DEWGONG](https://seacow.social/@dewgong) IS A POKEMON.

## how the magic happens
I'm following [this tutorial ](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) for developing a slack bot. Except where ever it talks about using the Slack API I'm going to just jam [this thing](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py) in.

## how to develop
I don't know how to write python so I'll let you know when I figure it out.

## how to use
There's only this README so I guess you are using it?

## don't @ me
